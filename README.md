## **How to Install and Run the Project**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rbac-ui.git  
cd rbac-ui  
```  

### **2. Install Dependencies**  
Use the package manager of your choice (npm or yarn) to install required dependencies:  
```bash  
npm install  
```  

### **3. Start the Development Server**  
Run the following command to launch the app in development mode:  
```bash  
npm start  
```  
- The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.  

### **4. (Optional) Start Mock API Server**  
If using a mock API for testing, start the mock server:  
```bash  
npm run mock-api  
```
